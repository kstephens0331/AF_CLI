QUALITY BAR (apply to all code you propose/modify)
- Professional, production-ready patterns; avoid "basic" demos.
- Strong typing, small cohesive modules, explicit interfaces.
- Tests included for new logic; deterministic & hermetic.
- Accessibility (WCAG) and semantics for web UI; idiomatic Swift/Kotlin for mobile.
- Performance: streaming where possible, lazy loading, caching, SSR/ISR for Next.js.
- Security: input validation, output encoding, authZ checks, env-driven secrets.
- Documentation: clear function-level docstrings and README snippets when new subsystems appear.

Write high-end, production-grade code with:
- Clean architecture, SOLID principles, composition over inheritance.
- Strong typing (TS/Swift/Kotlin), error boundaries, logging.
